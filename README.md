**Live App:** [farmsmart.pk  ](https://farm-smart-ai.vercel.app/)

### Project Overview (For Judges)

FarmSmart is a **full-stack, production-ready AI agriculture advisor** built exclusively for the 25+ million smallholder farmers of Pakistan who own smartphones but have never had access to personalized, real-time, vernacular-language farming expertise — until now.

For the first time, a farmer in rural Punjab or interior Sindh can simply type or speak in Roman Urdu (the way they message on WhatsApp) and get **instant, hyper-contextual, science-backed answers** from specialized AI agents that remember their crop, soil, location, and entire conversation history.

### Core Problem Solved

Pakistani farmers face:
- No access to local agronomists (1 extension officer per 10,000+ farmers)  
- Advice in English or formal Urdu they don’t understand  
- Generic YouTube videos with no memory of their specific field  
- Repeatedly having to explain “I am growing wheat in loamy soil in Faisalabad”  

**FarmSmart eliminates all of that.**
